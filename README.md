This repository contains a collection of PowerShell scripts developed through self-directed learning.
The scripts are focused on real-world use cases such as:

Automating system cleanup and tool updates (Scoop, Chocolatey)

Monitoring IP, disk space, and website uptime with alerts (e.g., via ntfy)

Scheduling tasks using Windows Task Scheduler

Backup routines to S3/MinIO using Rclone

Creating custom PowerShell CLI utilities

This learning project forms part of my CPD (Continuing Professional Development) in the area of:

Windows-based system automation

DevOps scripting and tooling

PowerShell language fundamentals

Real-time infrastructure monitoring and logging

All scripts are organized by level, starting from basic to advanced, with the goal of building a practical toolbox for both personal and professional infrastructure management.
